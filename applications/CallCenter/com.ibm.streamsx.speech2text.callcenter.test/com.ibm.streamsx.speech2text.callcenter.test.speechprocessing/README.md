# Test Instructions
1. Build and submit the SpeechProcessing applications
2. Build and submit this test application (once completely done with 1). See submit_example.sh for sample commands. 
3. Once tuple flow has completed, cancel SpeechProcessing jobs -> This will allow the TcpSink Operator to flush all of its data to the test application
