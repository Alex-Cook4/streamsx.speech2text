# streamsx.speech2text Repository
This repository provides supporting applications/solutions, as well as microservices
for effective transformation and analysis of speech to text in a Streams application
using the product-included Speech2Text Toolkit. 

## This is NOT the Speech2Text Toolkit
Using the Speech2Text toolkit with the WatsonS2T operator requires purchase of the IBM Streams product and is included
as a separate download (no extra cost).
